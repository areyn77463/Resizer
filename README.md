# Resizer
This program is a simple GUI that allows users to resize photos to a fraction of their original size and save them to a destination. It also exports data on the process to an Excel sheet with graphs. The program is built using Python and the tkinter, opencv, and openpyxl libraries.

## Skills Developed
While working on this project, I learned how to:

 - Use tkinter to create a simple and easy-to-use GUI
 - Use opencv to resize photos
 - Use openpyxl to export data to an Excel sheet
 - Use openpyxl to create populate bar and pie graphs
 
## Running the Program
To run the program, you will need to have Python and the tkinter, opencv, and openpyxl libraries installed on your computer. You can then clone this repository and run the following command from the root directory:

`python main.py`

This will open the GUI, and you can use:
1. The first folder to set the destination of the original images
2. The second folder to set the save destination
3. The **Preview** button to preview the a resized image next to the original
4. The **Work** button to start the resizing process
5. The **Details** button to create a .xlsx file detailing the process
6. The return arrow to set all options to default

There are tooltips if you hover over the any of the options. Have fun resizing!!
